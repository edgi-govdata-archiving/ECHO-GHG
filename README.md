# GHG emission by company
This repo hosts a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing greenhouse gas emissions reported to USEPA by corporate owner.

Under the US Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), a variety of emitters are required to count and report their emissions anually. 

Conceptually this is similar to reporting pollutant discharages under the Clean Water Act's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), but whereas NPDES has legal teeth - facilities are permitted to release only so much of a pollutant into the water - there is no such equivalent legislation for greenhouse gases (GHGs).

Facilities reporting GHGs are also required to report information about ownership - the share a parent company has in the facility. Through this information we can determine not just which specific facilities reported the most GHGs every year, but which companies can be said to be the most responsible in terms of their ownership of these facilities.

The GHGRP does not attempt to account for all of the US's GHG emissions; the [GHG Inventory](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks) does that. But GHGRP focuses on industrial direct emitters and some suppliers above certain thresholds. As EPA notes, "The GHGRP does not represent total U.S. GHG emissions, but provides facility level data for large sources of direct emissions, thus representing the majority of U.S. GHG emissions. The GHGRP data collected from direct emitters represent about half of all U.S. emissions." Including estimates from suppliers of fossil fuels, the GHGRP dataset [can account for](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/learn-about-greenhouse-gas-reporting-program-ghgrp) up to 90% of all US emissions. 

As EPA [notes](https://ccdsupport.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=98598976), "Data from direct emitters and suppliers cannot be viewed together because it would cause double counting of emissions in many sectors.  In general, it is more accurate to look at upstream (also called suppliers) data separately from downstream (also called direct emitters) data." EPA [elaborates](https://ccdsupport.com/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=98598975) on the differences between direct emitters and suppliers:

> "Direct emitters" are facilities that combust fuels or otherwise put GHGs into the atmosphere directly from their facility.  An example of this is a power plant that burns coal or natural gas and emits carbon dioxide directly into the atmosphere...."Suppliers" are those entities that supply products into the economy which if combusted, released or oxidized emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  These fuels and industrial gases are not emitted from the supplier facility but instead distributed throughout the country and used.  An example of this is gasoline, which is sold in the U.S. and primarily burned in cars throughout the country."

This notebook uses self-reported data from both emitters and suppliers to estimate GHG emissions by parent company.

# How to start contributing to this repo
* Instructions go here
* Developer setup (if relevant)
* Slack channel (if relevant)

**Suggestions for additional components of Readmes:**
* A "How to use" section if the repo's project is a tool or website
* A link to the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue+user%3Aedgi-govdata-archiving) label (this link across EDGI, or a specific link for the repo)
* Highlight "ready" label on issues to mean "this is an issue that is ready to work on and needs an owner"
* Additional badges at the top, such as code quality indicators
* "[All contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key)" listing, following these additional guidelines (example: [web-monitoring-db contributors list](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db#contributors)):
  - Compact representation without avatars (less visual noise; easier to focus on contributions)
  - Icons are links with title attributes (accessibility)
  - Alphabetical order by surname/name/username (to eliminate implied ranking)
  - Presence in the list (and the name used) is optional and up to the contributor (not everyone wants to be listed â€” we offer, but do not add unless someone explicitly says yes)

**When using this template, please look through all of the files to ensure they apply to the new repo.**
